# The Civic Kernel

**A thin, capture-resistant protocol for democratic decision-making** — with a
machine-checked stress-test suite and a comparative-law corpus that hold the design
against real situations and real legal systems.

**Start with [`KERNEL.md`](KERNEL.md)** — the whole kernel distilled to one page:
four services, four verbs, two formats, one floor, twelve refusals, and what is measured.

### Read it live

- **[The architecture →](https://glassontin.github.io/civic-kernel/)**  the proposal: a thin waist, four services, rights as invariants
- **[Real life against the protocol →](https://glassontin.github.io/civic-kernel/scenarios.html)**  19 stress-test stories, each machine-validated against the schemas
- **[Real legal systems, compared →](https://glassontin.github.io/civic-kernel/scenarios.html#corpus)**  the same 30 rights across the UK, Germany, the US, and the EU Charter

## Layout

- **`KERNEL.md`** — the distilled normative core: goals, threats, services, verbs, waist, refusals, measured status.
- **`index.html`** — the architecture document.
- **`proto/`** — the first running code: the club-vote election end to end (all four verbs, real
  signatures, real Merkle log, independent verifier, committed reference transcript). `proto/test.sh` is the success test.
- **`docs/`** — the functional (dynamics) model and the UK-trajectory worked example.
- **`schema/`** — the "waist": the two universal formats, as JSON Schema (Draft 2020-12).
  - `log-entry.schema.json` — one transparency-log event (includes the `coercive.act` type,
    whose body must cite its authorizing rule).
  - `manifest.schema.json` — a community's conformance manifest: which services and which of the
    30 UDHR invariants it upholds, its `decisions.coercion_resistance`, and its `rights_guard.remedy`.
- **`scenarios/`** — imagined human situations, each walked through the four verbs. Every embedded
  manifest and log entry is validated against the waist schemas, and every scenario must cite
  documented real-world precedents for its attack pattern (a required `precedents` field, 46
  citations verified July 2026). `scenario.schema.json` is the record format.
- **`corpus/`** — real legal systems captured under the same schema, sharing the 30-invariant spine:
  - `uk/` — Human Rights Act 1998 (via legislation.gov.uk) + real Commons divisions as `decision.closed` entries.
  - `de/` — Grundgesetz (via gesetze-im-internet.de).
  - `us/` — US Constitution and Bill of Rights.
  - `eu/` — EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (scope conditional under Art 51).
- **`scenarios.html`** — a self-contained browsable site rendering the scenarios and the comparative
  corpus. Data is inlined, so it serves as static files (GitHub Pages-ready); no runtime network calls.
- **`tools/`** — validators that also rebuild the inlined data in `scenarios.html`.

## Build / validate

Requires Python 3 and `jsonschema`:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
python tools/validate.py         # validate scenarios; rebuild scenario-data in scenarios.html
python tools/validate-corpus.py  # validate corpus;    rebuild corpus-data in scenarios.html
```

Both exit non-zero on any validation failure. The site is pre-built (data already inlined), so it
deploys without running these — running them is how you regenerate it after editing a scenario or corpus file.

## Honest caveats

- The scenarios are **fiction anchored to fact**: the people and places are invented, but every
  attack pattern cites documented real-world precedents (each checked against its source when
  added, July 2026). They are plausibility tests of the architecture, not records of real events;
  the verdicts (`holds` / `strains` / `breaks`) are the harness's reading of the architecture
  document's own claims and limits, not endorsements.
- The comparative rights-map is a **coarse** mapping of UDHR articles to domestic constitutional
  provisions from public legal sources. It points to where systems differ; it is not legal advice
  or authoritative comparative-law scholarship, and some cells are debatable.
- `proto/` is the first and only running code: a deliberately minimal four-verb loop whose manifest
  declares its own subtractions (commit-then-reveal pseudonymous ballots with cast-or-audit
  challenges; no receipt-freeness — see `proto/README.md`). Everything else is specification,
  test suite, and corpus; signatures inside the *scenarios'* embedded artifacts remain placeholders.
